# Flutter Chat App Backend

This repository houses the robust backend services powering the real-time chat application. It leverages a RESTful API architecture for efficient data management and utilizes WebSockets for real-time communication features like instant messaging and live typing indicators. The backend implements secure user authentication with hashed passwords, pagination for managing extensive chat histories and enforces end-to-end encryption for messages.
